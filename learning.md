Sharing some weird things I've learned in life.

## Year 2025

- <span style="color: #90EE90">learning: strike a match</span>

I want to light aromatherapy candles to unwind at home, and I only get matches. I was nervous about striking matches. Then I did it every day to get me the hopeful glow, first clumsily and then gradually confidently. Now I can strike a match and even hold it steady to light the wick of a nearly used-up jar candle.

- <span style="color: #90EE90">learning: sleeping with ants without being bothered</span>

I've never found pests in my Shanghai apartment. Now ants seem unavoidable in wooden houses in the US. They even survive pest control. The good thing is they are of a small size type.

- <span style="color: #E0CCE6"> becoming: in a less materialistic phase </span>

I loved buying all kinds of clothes and jewelry, and trying new restaurants and cuisines. Looking for expensive stuff to fill myself.
Since coming to the U.S., I feel like I don’t have as many material desires anymore. I think I can live a low-consumption lifestyle, and that’s the change in myself that I love the most.
