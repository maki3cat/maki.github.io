## 2025 H1

- Reading "Jean-Christophe" by Romain Rolland ;
- Watching "White Lotus 3", "the Newsroom 1-3" ;
- Seeing "Oppenheimer" for three times; Oh, my god, I love him;
- Reviewing 天龙八部 again, googled the theme, the author said the theme is "you cannot get what you want";

- Staying in US, no travels just for fun;
- No gaming;
