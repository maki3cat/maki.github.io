## Aggressive or Aversive Patterns

_Topic: Interpersonal Skills
Reference to: The Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Skills Workbook_

In your family of origin, you observed how people solved interpersonal problems, and you began to model your own behavior based on what you saw.
If members of your family dealt with conflicts using anger, blame, or withdrawal, these are the strategies you may have learned to use as well.

Techniques for influencing others using fear, shame, or hurtful psychological pressure are called **aversive strategies**. These are eight of them:

I think 1,2,3 are really alarming. 4,5,6 are of one group showing we don't care others, and 7,8 are of one group which moves from punishing by taking aways something to directly abandoning the person. The examples are important to indicate how seemingly normal words and sentences can be aversive techinques which gives rise to toxic relationships and kills effective interpersonal efforts from the other side leaving us no way but to leave the connection/relationship.

1. **THREATENING**:
  - <span style="color: #90EE90">Example: Hey, okay, I won't ask you to help me again. Maybe I will go kill myself and then you can live a happier life without me.</span>
  - Real Message: Do what I want or I will hurt myself/you.

2. **BLAMING**:

3. **GUILT-TRIPPING**:

4. **DISCOUNTING**:
  - <span style="color: #90EE90">Example: You've been watching TV all day; so why do you expect me to come home and cook for you? X</span>
  - Real Message: Their feelings/needs are invalid and not important.

5. **BELITTLING/DENIGRATING**:

6. **DERAILING**:

7. **TAKING AWAY**:

8. **WITHDRAWING/ABANDONING**:
  - Real Message: Do what I want, or I will leave you.
